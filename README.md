# The-HackerRank-Interview-Preparation-Kit-_-Brice-Zakra-SOLUTIONS-in-PYTHON





HACKERRANK provided us 69 CODING CHALLENGES including ARRAYS, DICTIONARIES & HASHMAPS, SORTING, STRING MANIPULATION, GREEDING ALGORITHMS, SEARCH, DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING, STACKS & QUEUES, GRAPHS, TREES, LINKED LISTS and RECURSION & BACKTRACKING, 





While playing around and testing my CODING SKILLS in PYTHON on WWW.HACKERRANK.COM, I will consistently push every single day at least one solution of the INTERVIEW-PREPARATION-KIT-CHALLENGE until the last one.
