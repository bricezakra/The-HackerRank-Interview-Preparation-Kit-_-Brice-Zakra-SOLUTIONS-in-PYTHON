HACKERRANK provided us 69 CODING CHALLENGES including ARRAYS, DICTIONARIES & HASHMAPS, SORTING, STRING MANIPULATION, GREEDING ALGORITHMS, SEARCH, DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING, STACKS & QUEUES, GRAPHS, TREES, LINKED LISTS and RECURSION & BACKTRACKING, 





My ultimate goal for this personal exercise is to consistently push at least one solution in python of the INTERVIEW-PREPARATION-KIT-CHALLENGE every single day until the last one.
